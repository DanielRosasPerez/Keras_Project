# Keras_Project
Hi, In this repo I have made a facial recognizer. This CNN was trained using photos of me and my family :)  

The **CNNs created in Keras** are in the file called **Modelos_CNN.ipynb**.  

The **final result of this project** is showed in the video called **Video_Bordes_30.mp4**. I didn't have a video card so I trained my model on Google Colab pro.  

I have more about **Keras** and **Opencv** on my **gists**, and I have some **neural networks** from that I made **from scratch**, here, **in my repositories**.

Thank u so much! :)
